        Initializes a constant agent which returns a constant action of the provided shape.

        Args:
            states_spec: Dict containing at least one state definition. In the case of a single state,
               keys `shape` and `type` are necessary. For multiple states, pass a dict of dicts where each state
               is a dict itself with a unique name as its key.
            actions_spec: Dict containing at least one action definition. Actions have types and either `num_actions`
                for discrete actions or a `shape` for continuous actions. Consult documentation and tests for more.
            device: Device string specifying model device.
            scope: TensorFlow scope, defaults to agent name (e.g. `dqn`).
            saver_spec: Dict specifying automated saving. Use `directory` to specify where checkpoints are saved. Use
                either `seconds` or `steps` to specify how often the model should be saved. The `load` flag specifies
                if a model is initially loaded (set to True) from a file `file`.
            summary_spec: Dict specifying summaries for TensorBoard. Requires a 'directory' to store summaries, `steps`
                or `seconds` to specify how often to save summaries, and a list of `labels` to indicate which values
                to export, e.g. `losses`, `variables`. Consult neural network class and model for all available labels.
            distributed_spec: Dict specifying distributed functionality. Use `parameter_server` and `replica_model`
                Boolean flags to indicate workers and parameter servers. Use a `cluster_spec` key to pass a TensorFlow
                cluster spec.
            discount: Float specifying reward discount factor.
            normalize_rewards: Boolean flag specifying whether to normalize rewards, default False.
            variable_noise: Experimental optional parameter specifying variable noise (NoisyNet).
            preprocessing: Optional list of preprocessors (e.g. `image_resize`, `grayscale`) to apply to state. Each
                preprocessor is a dict containing a type and optional necessary arguments.
            exploration: Optional dict specifying exploration type (epsilon greedy strategies or Gaussian noise)
                and arguments.
            reward_preprocessing: Optional dict specifying reward preprocessor using same syntax as state preprocessing.
            batched_observe: Optional int specifying how many observe calls are batched into one session run.
                Without batching, throughput will be lower because every `observe` triggers a session invocation to
                update rewards in the graph.
            action_values: Action value specification, must match actions_spec names
